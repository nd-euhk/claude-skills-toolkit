# Changelog

All notable changes to the skills-toolkit plugin are documented here.

## [2.20.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **test-writer:** New subagent for writing failing TDD tests with context isolation. Model: sonnet, permission: acceptEdits.
- **implementer:** New subagent for writing minimum TDD implementation code. Model: opus, permission: acceptEdits.
- **reviewer:** New read-only subagent for code quality and architecture compliance reviews. Model: sonnet, permission: plan.

### Changed
- **orchestrate 2.4.0:** Added dedicated execution agents (test-writer, implementer, reviewer) replacing starter-kit references.
- **orchestrate 2.4.0:** Fixed board/backlog ownership — agt-configurator no longer creates board/backlog directly; sprint skill handles all board/backlog operations.
- **orchestrate 2.4.0:** Clarified LLD section count — forward engineering uses 9 sections, reverse engineering uses 10 (adds API Surface detected from controller code).
- **agt-configurator:** Removed Core Workflow 4 (Board & Backlog). Board/backlog are now exclusively managed by sprint skill.
- **agt-configurator:** Fixed conventions.md path to use per-layer paths (backend/conventions.md + frontend/conventions.md) per SDLC standard.
- **lld-designer:** Documented 9 vs 10 section distinction between forward and reverse engineering modes. Removed tech-design/README.md from output.
- **new-feature-workflow.md:** Added SRS-BACKEND.md / SRS-FRONTEND.md as optional large-team outputs. Added service README.md to Phase 08 output list.

## [2.19.0] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **orchestrate 2.1.0:** Added Plan Mode Protocol for pre-execution planning in New Feature, Change Request, and Explore workflows. Orchestrator now enters plan mode via EnterPlanMode, delegates to Plan subagent for orchestration planning, writes plan to `.work/plans/YYYYMMDD/` via general-purpose:sonnet, presents for human confirmation, and exits via ExitPlanMode before execution. Added EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode to allowed-tools.

## [2.18.0] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **orchestrate 2.0.0:** Complete overhaul of explore/reverse-engineering workflow. All phases now use per-project delegation (1 subagent per project per phase, running in parallel). New `project_registry.yaml` SSOT produced by Step 1d for all subsequent phases. All output paths now project-qualified (`agent_docs/projects/{project}/...`) to prevent name collisions. Epic names auto-detected from code structure via domain detection. Added reverse-engineering mode sections to 5 agent definitions (hld-architect, srs-specifier, lld-designer, imp-specifier, tst-specifier) with code-reading paths. Steps 6-7 support batching for projects with >30 FRs.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **orchestrate 1.2.0:** Refined explore workflow Step 1 (Scout Codebase Structure). Step 1a now explicitly instructs Explore subagent to use `glob` and `bash` for filesystem discovery, with dedicated git submodule detection (`git submodule status`, `.gitmodules` parsing). Discovery covers 5 categories: git submodules, build system clusters, monorepo structures, deployable units, and independent directory clusters. Added expected output format table for structured reporting. Replaced redundant Step 1b-split section with concise Scouting Summary.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-03-06

### Changed
- **skill-composer 2.8.0:** Reduced SKILL.md from 575→479 lines (under 500 target). Converted 4 interview JSON blocks to compact prose (Interview 1, Interview 2, escape hatch, BATCH 2 Q1). Condensed Reference Guide from 4-5 lines per step to 1 line per step while preserving all content and agent decision-making context. All functionality and reference details intact; JSON structure detail remains in `references/ask-user-question-patterns.md`.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-03-06

### Changed
- **ask-user-question 1.1.0:** Refined for production: reduced SKILL.md from 522→498 lines (under 500 target), linked 2 orphaned references (common-mistakes.md, free-text-input-patterns.md) so all 5 reference files are now discoverable, fixed tool scoping (removed unused Write), improved question design guidance with consolidation, simplified plan mode content. All 80% rule applied correctly; core patterns in SKILL.md, edge cases in references.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-03-06

### Changed
- **skill-composer 2.7.0:** Renamed from `skill-creator` to `skill-composer` to avoid shadowing Claude's native skill-creator skill. All functionality preserved; invocation via `/skills-toolkit:skill-composer`. Updated frontmatter, all references in documentation, and plugin metadata.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **subagent-creator 1.4.0:** Added Step 3b "Write reliable delegation prompts" in Reference Guide. New reference file `delegation-patterns.md` documents proven delegation patterns from production implementations (skill-tester parallel agents, skill-creator delegation chains). Includes pattern templates, parallel execution patterns, constraint handling, output specifications, and real working examples. Helps users write reliable subagent prompts with consistent, predictable results.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **skill-tester 1.1.0:** Added Quick Workflow mode for fast skill validation (alternative to Full Pipeline). Quick Workflow: only runs with_skill agent (no baseline), excludes timing metrics, no aggregation. Shows simple pass/fail on assertions. Perfect for rapid iteration. Users choose between Quick (fast check) or Full (comprehensive benchmark) in Phase 1. Standardized artifact location to centralized `./evals/<skill-name>/` at project root. Updated eval-schema reference documentation with new structure.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **skill-tester 1.0.0:** New skill implementing evaluation-driven development pipeline for Claude Code skills. Enables empirical testing with 7-phase workflow: setup → create evals → run tests (parallel with_skill + baseline) → grade results → aggregate benchmark → review summary → iterate. Includes Ruby aggregation script for computing pass rates, token usage, and timing deltas. Supports multi-iteration testing with workspace structure tracking improvement across iterations.

### Changed
- **skill-creator 2.6.0:** Integrated complete workflow: create → refine (optional) → test (optional). Added Step 3.9 for optional skill-refiner integration (validate/improve quality), and Step 3.10 for optional skill-tester integration (empirical validation). Both refinement and testing are user-optional, enabling natural progression from creation through validation. Added Agent tool to allowed-tools for delegating to skill-refiner and skill-tester.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **ask-user-question 1.0.0:** New skill for implementing interactive user input with the AskUserQuestion tool. Covers constraints, patterns, response handling, conditional workflows, and production patterns.
